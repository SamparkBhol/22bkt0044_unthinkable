# Manage Recipes & Leaderboard — polish notes

What I changed

- Improved ManageRecipes UI with:
  - Loading state (spinner) while importing or reading files.
  - Basic error handling around file reading, JSON parsing, clipboard actions and localStorage operations.
  - Accessible live region for toast messages to notify users of success/errors without blocking the UI.
  - Copy/Delete buttons now show success/error toasts and are disabled while loading.
  - Clear leaderboard action now shows a success toast and handles errors.

Why these changes

- Provide better feedback: Users get immediate confirmation when importing, copying, or deleting recipes.
- Resilience: Basic try/catch around file, clipboard and storage ops reduces silent failures.
- Accessibility: aria-live for messages improves screen-reader behavior.

How to test

1. Open the app (npm run dev) and go to the Manage Recipes panel.
2. Paste valid recipe JSON and click "Import pasted JSON" — you should see a toast and the custom count update.
3. Try importing invalid JSON — you should see an error toast.
4. Upload a JSON file via the Upload file button — a spinner appears while reading.
5. Click Copy on a single recipe and Copy JSON to copy all custom recipes — clipboard access may prompt the browser.
6. Use Clear leaderboard to remove stored scores.

Notes & next improvements

- Add a small toast component used globally (currently toasts are local to ManageRecipes). This will let other components reuse the same UI and stack messages.
- Add unit tests to cover import validation and error scenarios.
- Consider moving heavy JSON parsing/validation to a web worker for very large files.
